## __MultiProcessing__
Working of different processes simultaneously in parallel, each in its own separate memory space

#### When to use
1. Parallel execution : Those task which require multiple core of CPU
2. CPU bound task :  Tasks that are heavy on cpu to execute simultaneously ex:mathematical computaions, data processing


| **Aspect**              | **Concurrent Execution**              | **Parallel Execution**                  |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Nature**              | Tasks overlap in time (interleaved),creates illusion of parallelism,. | Tasks run simultaneously (true parallelism). |
| **Hardware Requirement** | Can run on a single-core CPU.        | Requires multi-core or distributed system. |
| **Efficiency**          | Better for I/O-bound tasks.          | Better for CPU-bound tasks.             |
| **Execution**           | Time-slicing to switch between tasks.| True simultaneous execution.            |
| **Use Case**            | Multithreading (e.g., network requests). | Multiprocessing (e.g., heavy computations). |
| **Resource Sharing**    | Threads share memory space.          | Processes have separate memory spaces.  |
