### __Multithreading__
Multithreading is a technique in which multiple threads are executed within a single process. It allows a program to perform multiple operations concurrently, sharing the same resources (memory space), but each thread runs independent

#### When to use
1. I/O bound task : as multithreading allows multiple theards to keep working while also waiting for i/o task simultaneously, ex : network requests, file reading/writing

2. concurrent execution : multithreading is also used when concurrent execution is required, i.e where each task needs to run independently and parallel, ex : downloading files, processing user input
