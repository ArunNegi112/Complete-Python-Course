## Flask framework
Flask - complete web-framework create with the help of python.  
It is a tool used to create `web applications` and `APIs`.  
__API__ : Application programing interface - set of rules to connect software applications.  
Flask is useful when we need to create end-to-end projects, it helps in deployment, collaboration, sharing of project

_Things we gonna learn :_
1. WSGI - web server gateway interface
2. Jinja 2 template engine

## `WSGI` - Web Server Gateway Interface
WSGI is the gateway of communication between web server and web application to redirect requests from server to application and give back response  

You develop the web application using Flask.  
You deploy it to a web server.  
The WSGI acts as a bridge between the web server and your Flask app.  
The web server, WSGI server, and Flask app work together to handle user requests and return responses.  

ex of web server : `Nginx`, `Microsoft IIS`, `Apache HTTP server`,`Lighttp`  
ex of WSGI : `Gunicorn`,`CherryPy`,`uWSGI`

## `Jinja 2` : Template engine 
Jinja2 is the default template engine that enables you to insert dynamic data into web-templates by using placeholders and backend data. It connects your backend (where the data is stored or processed) with the frontend (where the content is displayed), making web applications more interactive,dynamic and personalized.

Dynamic data refers to data that changes or varies over time or depending on user interaction.
